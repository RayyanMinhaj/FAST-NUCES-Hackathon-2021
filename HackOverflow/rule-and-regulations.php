                <h3>Medium of Instruction</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.1 The medium of instruction and examinations for all courses is English (except language
                    courses, other than English, and Islamic Studies). </p>
                <h3>Academic Year</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.2 Academic Year of the university starts in August/September and ends in May/June of
                    the subsequent year.
                    1.3 There are two regular semesters, namely, Fall and Spring, in an academic year.<br>
                    1.4 Fall semester starts in August/September and ends in December/January.<br>
                    1.5 Spring Semester starts in January/February and ends in May/June.<br>
                    1.6 A regular semester is spread over 15/16 weeks of teaching, and 2 weeks of final
                    examinations.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Credit Hours</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.7 One credit hour means teaching a theory course for one classroom-teaching hour each
                    week throughout the semester.<br>
                    1.8 A classroom-teaching hour or one period is of 50 to 60 minutes.
                    <br>1.9 A theory course is normally assigned 2 to 4 credit hours, depending on its content.
                    <br>1.10 A lab or workshop is normally assigned 1 or 2 credit hours.
                    <br>1.11 One credit hour of lab work is equivalent to 3 hours of laboratory or practical work per
                    week throughout the semester.
                    <br>1.12 A 4 credit hour course, for example, having 3 credit hours of theory and 1 credit hour of
                    associated lab is designated as a (3+1) credit hour course.
                </p>

                <h3>Scheduling of Classes</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.13 All classes are held at scheduled hours, timely communicated to students through
                    notification of time table by the concerned Academic Office.
                    <br>1.14 In case of any unavoidable situation a class may be postponed and rescheduled under
                    the following procedure:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) All classes are rescheduled only through the Academic Office, with the approval of
                      the concerned Head of Department (HoD). <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Faculty members shall not reschedule any class at their own discretion.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The academic office will be informed before the cancellation of class so that
                    ;   students are informed well in time.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) For pre-planned activities (conferences, etc.) during regular class hours, the
                        concerned Head of Department has to be informed and formal permission sought
                        beforehand.<br>
                    1.15 If the requirement of minimum lectures is not being met (due to unavoidable
                    circumstances), and it is not possible to schedule them in free periods during the
                    working weeks, classes may be rescheduled on weekends, local or national holidays.
                    1.16 A class can be scheduled for 1½ period, that is, for duration of 80 to 90 minutes with
                    the approval of the Head of the Department.</p>


                <h3>Normal Semester Course Load</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.17 Normal semester course load for undergraduate students, who are not on academic
                    warning/probation, is as per the university study plan.
                    1.18 The Head of Department may change the course load keeping in view the availability of
                    courses, student’s academic performance or academic warning status.
                    1.19 A student can register for a maximum of two courses in summer semester, in
                    accordance with the rules for summer semester.
                    1.20 A student can only register for courses for which he/she has passed all the pre-requisite
                    courses as specified in the approved curriculum.</p>


                <h3>Attendance Requirements</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.21 Students are required to maintain 100% attendance in lectures, labs, tutorials, seminars
                    and discussions as prescribed by the course instructor. Absence of a maximum of 20%
                    of the total attendance may be condoned by the HoD for genuine reasons, such as
                    illness, etc.<br>
                    1.22 Failure to meet attendance requirements in a course will render the student ineligible to
                    appear in the final examination of the concerned course.</p>


                <h3>Bachelor’s Degree Requirements</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">1.23 The minimum duration of a bachelor’s degree is four academic years (8 regular
                    semesters) and a maximum of 7 years.<br>
                    1.24 When a student is readmitted with credit exemptions from a previous admission, the
                    maximum duration allowed to complete the degree will be counted from the date of first
                    admission.<br>
                    1.25 Each bachelor’s degree program is of minimum of 130 credit hours. A program may
                    have more credit hours as approved by the university.<br>
                    1.26 Minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.00 is required for graduation.<br></p>



                <br>
                <br>
                <h1 style="">2. <i>Grading and GPA Calculations</i></h1>
                <h3>Grade Point Average</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">2.1 The Grade Point Average (GPA) provides a continuous scale for grades earned. Two
                    types of averages are computed for the grades obtained by a student, the Semester Grade
                    Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA gives
                    the GPA of courses completed in a semester, whereas CGPA gives the GPA of all courses
                    completed so far by a student.</p>


                <h3>Interpretation of Letter Grades</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">2.2 Interpretation of Letter Grades is as follows:</p>

                <h3>GPA Calculation</h3>
                <p style="color: #3b5998">
                    2.4 SGPA is calculated as follows:<br>
                    SGPA = (P1*C1 + P2*C2 + P3*C3 + P4*C4)/C
                    <br>2.5 Where P1, P2, P3 and P4 are the grade points earned in particular courses, while C1, C2,
                    C3, C4 are the credit hours of respective course studied in the semester and C is the
                    number of total credits attempted in the semester, that is, C= C1+C2+C3+C4.
                    <br>2.6 CGPA is calculated as the weighted average for all semesters cumulatively using grade
                    points of all the courses taken by a student.
                    <br>2.7 In CGPA calculation for such courses that have been repeated, only the most recent grade
                    points are used, even if they are less than the earlier attempts.
                    <br>2.8 “W” will be awarded for withdrawn courses. It will appear on the transcript but will not
                    affect the CGPA.
                    5
                    <br>2.9 “I” is a temporary grade given for incomplete work. If it is not changed to an earned
                    grade, it shall automatically convert to F grade after a fixed time communicated by the
                    competent authorit</p>
